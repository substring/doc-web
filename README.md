# This is a test site using github pages

This text is written in markdown, not HTML, which makes it **so much easier** to type.

## What is this website for

test, have fun, experiment with github/jekyll/markdown

Fooling around with markdown, we can have some lists like:
- 1st item
- 2nd item
- 3rd item
